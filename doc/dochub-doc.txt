1. Introduction                                   *dochub*

dochub.vim quickly opens API Documentation from DocHub.io 
(http://dochub.io) and RubyDoc.info (http://rubydoc.info)
for the following supported |filetypes|:

* CSS
* HTML
* JavaScript
* PHP
* Python
* Ruby

dochub.vim is enabled by 'filetype'. While editing a supported file,
simply place the cursor over a class, property, or method and type `HH`.
The plugin will then open a new tab in your browser (or a new instance of
the browser) to the related docs. That's it.

2. Configuration                                  *dochub-configuration*

By default, dochub.vim uses the 'open' command for OS X or the
xdg-open <http://portland.freedesktop.org/xdg-utils-1.0/xdg-open.html>
command for other OSes to look up the docs. You can easily change the command. 
For exampe:
                                                   *dochub_command*  >

    let g:dochub_command='gnome-open'

Furthermore you can choose your own mapping in the following way:
                                                   *dochub_mapping*  >

    let g:dochub_mapping='<C-h>'
