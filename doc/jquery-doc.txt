Introduction *jquery-doc-introduction*

When your cursor is on a jQuery method, type `JJ` (or your mapping, see
settings for that) and the plugin will open a new tab in your browser (or a
new instance of the browser) to the related docs. That's all.

Configuration *jquery-doc-configuration* *g:jquery_doc_command* *g:jquery_doc_mapping*

By default, the plugin uses the xdg-open command to look up the docs but you
can easily change the command. For example, if you are OSX you would like to
change it to:

    let g:jquery_doc_command='open'

Furthermore you can choose your own mapping in the following way:

    let g:jquery_doc_mapping='PP'
